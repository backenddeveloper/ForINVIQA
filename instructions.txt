Requirements of the Burroughs Test

When writing your Burroughs Test, you should create a small command-line utility to help a fictional
company determine the dates on which they need to pay salaries to their Sales Department.
The company handles their Sales payroll in the following way:
  
- Sales staff get a regular fixed base monthly salary, plus a monthly bonus
- The base salaries are paid on the last day of the month, unless that day is a Saturday, a Sunday
(weekend). In that case, salaries are paid before the weekend. For the sake of this application,
please do not take into account public holidays.
-On the 15th of every month bonuses are paid for the previous month, unless that day is a
weekend. In that case, they are paid the first Wednesday after the 15 th

The output of the utility should be a CSV file, containing the payment dates for the next twelve months.
The CSV file should contain a column for the month name, a column that contains the salary payment
date for that month, and a column that contains the bonus payment date.
